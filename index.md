I am a doctoral pre-candidate at [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/), University of Michigan advised by [Dr. Silvia Lindtner](http://www.silvialindtner.com/) and [Dr. Patricia Garcia](https://patriciagarcia.info/). My research lies at the intersection of labor and automation where I explore the emergent disruption in the informal labor markets because of algorithmic management of intermediary platforms. I specifically focus on the position of food delivery workers in the heteromated workflows of food delivery platforms in India.

Prior to my PhD, I was a Commonwealth Scholar at SOAS (University of London) where I completed my M.A. in Global Digital Cultures and worked closely with [Dr. Elisa Oreglia](http://www.ercolino.eu/index.html) as a research assistant at Dept. of Digital Humanities, King's College London. In the past, I have managed collaborative projects with feminist human rights organizations in India exploring ICT use for Sexuality and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights related information dissemination in communities with low Internet access.
