			<h2>2. Whose Country is Digital India?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I started collecting data about the <a href="https://digitalindia.gov.in/">Digital India Programme</a> in the Summer of 2018. Digital India is a campaign launched by the government of India to ensure delivery of essential government services electronically. Through a critical discourse analysis of the Digital India website, I unpack the material and cultural implications of the program's rhetoric of social transformation and Digital Empowerment by asking the question - how and whom does digital empowerment seek to empower? <strong>This project resulted in a publication that is currently under review for the special issue titled Digital Democracy with the journal Asiascape: Digital Asia.</strong></p>

					<h2>3. Kahi Ankahi Baatein</h2>
				</header>
				<p>In 2015-2017, I helped develop CREA's IVRS based mobile-phone infoline <a href="https://www.creaworld.org/events/kahi-ankahi-baatein-mobile-phone-based-info-line"><em>'Kahi Ankahi Baatein'</em></a> (Of spoken and unspoken things), an anonymous platform for young people in regions identified with digital divide. The infoline provided them access to essential information on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights in Hindi. In partnership with 6 community radio stations across India, we provided round-the-clock mobile-based service. The project reached out to a range of audience across geographies (urban, peri-urban, and rural), age, class, and accessibility. The project was in partnership with 6 community radio stations across India.</p>

			<h2>4. Global South Movement Building</h2>
		</header>
		<p>In 2014, I was the South Asia lead for an exploratory learning and planning process for movement building around violence against women and girls in the Global South (South America, Mesoamerica, North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, South-East Asia, Pacific Islands, sub-Saharan Africa). This initiative was led by Raising Voices, which has actively been working on movement building in the Horn, East, and Southern Africa for prevention of Gender Based Violence. A full report of the consultation process can be found <a href="http://raisingvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Raising-Voices-Global-South-Movement-Building-Report.pdf">here.</a></p>

					<h2>5. Hearts and Minds: Women of India Speak (UN Women, India)</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Between 2012-2013, I was part of the team at UN Women, India that collected evidence from the “lived experiences” of women and girls at the grassroots to ensure that the voices of those who remain marginalized are meaningfully reflected in the post-2015 development discourse and agenda. The result of that process was the report titled <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2014/3/hearts-and-minds-women-of-india-speak">"Hearts and Minds: Women of India Speak"</a> that was presented at the UN General Assembly Meeting to influence the global agenda setting, ensuring that the post-2015 framework does not make the same mistakes that the MDGs did.</p>

			<h2>6. Gender and Essential Services in Low-Income Communities</h2>
		</header>
		<p>A Women in International Cities International (WICI), Canada commissioned project in New Delhi, India to study women’s rights and access to water and sanitation related (WATSAN) services. As a research assistant, I focused on studying women’s engagement with WATSAN infrastructure in Bhalaswa - an urban resettlement colony situated at the foothills of a landfill in Delhi. The project resulted in a <a href="https://idl-bnc-idrc.dspacedirect.org/bitstream/handle/10625/47973/IDL-47973.pdf">report</a>, which was a key document in policy advocacy for advancing access to basic WATSAN services to low income communities in New Delhi. This project was supported by the International Development Research Center. </p>
